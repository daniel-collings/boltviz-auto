# Boltviz Auto / Frontend

üë®‚Äçüíª This demo website was built for fun to experiment with Next.js using the latest version (13) along with TailwindCSS for rapid styling.

‚ö°Ô∏è Boltviz Auto is hosted at: [Boltviz Auto](https://boltviz-auto.netlify.app/)

üé® The demo website was developed using Next.js 13, which was currently in beta at the time of development. Read more about Next.js 13 here: [Next.js 13 Beta Docs](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs) 

üíΩ The frontend consumes data from a Sanity headless cms. Sanity is a fantastic headless option from my experience, which admittedly is limited, but I will be exploring alternatives such as Strapi in the near future.

## Learn More About Next.js

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Further Development

No project is truly finished as this is certainly not the exception. Provided more time to refine the project I would cover such areas as listed below:

- [ ] Mobile nav transition animation for open/close
- [ ] A11y audit
- [ ] Cypress e2e testing
- [ ] Further content sections to provide more depth
- [ ] Subtle animations on scroll
- [ ] Gallery view on a specific car
- [ ] Hotspot the images used for an improved UI
- [ ] Mock contact form with recaptcha
- [ ] Light/dark mode toggle
- [ ] Login portal to redirect admin to CMS
